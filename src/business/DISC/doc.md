# DiSC Personality Test Integration

## Overview
The DiSC Personality Test is a behavioral assessment tool that identifies individuals' dominant traits. The DiSC model divides behavior into four main personality types: Dominance (D), Influence (I), Steadiness (S), and Conscientiousness (C).

## How It Works
1. **User Inputs**: Users answer a series of questions related to their behaviors and preferences.
2. **Processing Responses**: The application processes the responses to categorize the user's dominant traits.
3. **Displaying Results**: The results are displayed alongside other behavioral metrics in a summarized form and through visualizations.

## Usage
1. Input the behavioral metrics: Attention Span, Social Interaction Level, and Activity Level.
2. Respond to the DiSC Personality Test questions by selecting the most appropriate option.
3. Click "Submit" to view the summary and visualizations.
4. Optionally, click "Generate Report" to finalize the assessment.
